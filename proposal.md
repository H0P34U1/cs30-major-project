# Project proposal

My project will be about exploring creativity, allowing the player to put their thoughts unto the screen. 


## Needs to have a list
  - working draw tool, and color picker 
  - the fundamentals of a basic drawing game
      - a working draw tool. ie: pencil, brush, marker, spray can, fill tool(if possible without using grids).
      - change the transparency of each tool as well as the size
      - a working eraser tool
      - basic colors
      - a color picker
      - eyedropper tool
      - 2d shapes and variations of lines

## Nice to have a list
  - an image reference that pops up, the player tries to draw the image
  - fill in drawings, the player then has to fill each part with the right color 
    like the ones they gave us as kids to fill in with crayon
  - 3d viewing
  - a text tool
  - a sticker tool
  - ctrl + z to undo the recent action(if possible to do this with trails)
  - ctrl + y to redo the recent action(if possible to do this with trails)
  - zoom in/out
  - Some of these could be in the 'Needs to have a list' but I'm unsure if they can be created within the type of drawing game i'm making.
  - Like with the fill tool, i am unsure if it works with just a background and trails/lines.
