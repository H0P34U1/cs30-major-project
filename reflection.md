What advice would i give myself?
    To have picked an easier project to work on, there are so much code that goes into building an actual drawing game and i wish i had gone with something much more simple befitting of my knowledge in javascript. 
Was everything in my need to have list completed
    I managed to complete the majority of it but missed a few, instead finishing other things that were in the nice to have list.
The hardest part?
    The hardest part of this for me was the canvas, i had made various projects in p5js that all struggled with lag, my p5js project shows the most i knew about making a drawing game, I lacked the syntax knowledge and the know-how to create interesting UI's and functionality. Because of this i had to scour through the internet, ie: youtube, stackoverflow, discourse, and w3 schools.
Was there any problems i couldnt solve?
    Immediately, i ran into alot of problems writing the code like how i pictured it in my head, I initially would try to solve the issue for it to takes hours or day just to get nowhere which was extremely frustating so I relied on sources to show how each component i wanted to add was coded which still took alot of trial and error but I build something solid and stable instead of having little to show.
What am i most proud of?
    I am most proud of the finished product even if i used alot of help to get it to where it is. It is a bummer for me to have relied on these sources but I gained the knowledge and was able to code individually which was uplifting. I have now gained much more insight and knowledge into the workings of js and html, i know alot more syntax than i did before.
